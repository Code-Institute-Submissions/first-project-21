Haami!

# Haami
Haami is a Persian word that means "supporter". The website's vision is to provide opportunities for Afghanistan women to do online further education at home to become a freelancer and start working from home.
Haami is a website that tries to connect 3 groups of people. The first group is Afghanistan women who are not allowed to get educated and have jobs by the Taliban. The second group is supporters, those people around the world who want to help Afghanistan Women in this hard situation. And the third group is the institutes that provide online education. 
So online education centers can offer their courses and training on the website. At the same time, Afghanistan women can apply for the courses. Then supporters can select applicants among all the applicants and pay for the cost of the courses directly to the institutes. They can also track supported students' progress.

- __The home page image__
  - The home page image shows an Afghan woman wearing the Burka hijab, which she was forced to wear by the Taliban, buying a few slices of bread. I used this image to show the current situation of Afghan women. Bread has deep meaning and respect in Afghan culture. One of the common words for bread is "rozi" which means you earn money so that you can eat something. The woman in the picture represents Afghan women who worked, had jobs before, and could bring bread (rozi) to their home. But it is different now.  
  - There are logo and text on the home page image that make some questions in users' minds.

## Testing 
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
### Validator Testing 
- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS

### Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Other General Project Advice
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 
- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 
- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 
- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
